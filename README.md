# Email-spam-prediction
I used machine learning modules to complete this project.
Email spam prediction system is used to detect email spam using Machine Learning technique called Natural Language Processing and Python.
In this project we have a dataset contain a lot of emails by extract important words and then use naive classifier we can detect if this email is spam or not.
Mails are Categorized as 'Spam' or 'Ham' in the dataset.
By performing analysis and applying machine learning algorithms for building the predictive system, the model will predict the upcoming mail as spam or ham according to the research on the data.
A data science project aimed at creating a machine learning-based email spam prediction system.
Finally,this project predicts of email spam detection.
